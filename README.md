# Task-01: Data Visualization (Prodigy Infotech Internship)
This repository contains my submission for Task 01 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. Through this task, I explored data visualization techniques using a real-world population dataset from the World Bank.
## 📌 Objective
The objective of this task is to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable using a bar chart or histogram. This helps in understanding the data's structure and distribution patterns.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is from the official Prodigy Infotech repository:
[Task 1 Dataset](https://github.com/Prodigy-InfoTech/data-science-datasets/tree/main/Task%201)

File used: `population.csv` (or another relevant file)

## 🧪 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Visualizations
### 1. Histogram - Age Distribution
Displays how the ages are distributed in the population.

### 2. Bar Chart - Gender Distribution
Displays how many males and females are present.
